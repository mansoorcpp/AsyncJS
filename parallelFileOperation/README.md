Parallel Execution with Callbacks:

- Implement a function 'parallelFileOperation' that returns an array of size 2 with the first index containing the contents of the file 'a.txt' in UTF-8 encoding. If `a.txt` doesn't exist, then throw an error. The second element of the array contains 1 if the text `Hello!` is successfully written to the file `b.txt` and 0 if the write operation fails.
